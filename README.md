# Create a customized bootable Ubuntu ISO-image on Linux and MacOS
I ran into some troubles trying to create a customized bootable USB-stick with Ubuntu Server and AutoInstall. Also ChatGPT came up with poor advice so it was time for me to figure this out, once and for all :-)<br>

Since there are some differences between Linux and MacOS in doing this I wrote two instructions:<br>
- [Create a customized bootable Ubuntu ISO-image on Linux](LINUX.md)
- [Create a customized bootable Ubuntu ISO-image on MacOS](MACOS.md)

Honorable mention:<br>
